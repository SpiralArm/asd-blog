<h1>Small victories.</h1>

<p>From <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/sep/09/change-life-small-victories-burkeman?mobile-redirect=false">The Guardian</a>: "The striking conclusion [from a study of mood and activities] is that a sense of incremental progress is vastly more important to happiness than either a grand mission or financial incentives". &nbsp;</p>
<p>"The challenge, on a personal level, is remembering to notice the smaller things you've achieved. Keeping a "done" list, as well as or instead of a to-do list, is one remarkably effective idea."</p>
<p>In <a href="http://addsharedo.com">AddShareDo</a> we help you with this in two ways. &nbsp;First, there's the automatic daily email we send which includes tasks you completed in the last 24 hours. &nbsp;It also includes what your friends have done on shared tags, and added tasks.</p>
<p>Second, the Activity tab on the site shows you items added and also completed items, letting you get a sense of what you're getting through. &nbsp;You can go back beyond a single day with the activity view.</p>
<p>We hope you find ASD as productive as we do. <a href="http://addsharedo.com">Give it a go....</a></p>

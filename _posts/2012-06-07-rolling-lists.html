<h1>Rolling Lists</h1>

<p>Lifehack has a nice article: <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/hate-your-to-do-list-try-a-rolling-list-instead.html">Hate Your To-Do List? Try A Rolling List Instead</a>.</p>
<p>The core steps are to list the steps, and prioritise them, and tackle them in order. &nbsp;You can do this with Add Share Do: no need to fight "priority numbers" or "importance", just use the drag handle (=) on the right of every todo and drag a todo to where it should be on your list. &nbsp;Simple.</p>

<h1>New and Noteworthy 239</h1>

<p>Tonights update to <a href="http://www.addsharedo.com/">AddShareDo.com</a> is a bug fix release, but this includes a couple of annoyances you may have&nbsp;noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 11.6667px;">Tasks emailed in to your secret ASD email address were not appearing in the Activity section. &nbsp;They are now.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11.6667px;">When a task contains web addresses, ASD shows a menu to give you quick access to those links. &nbsp;Clicking complete didn't close the menu. &nbsp;It does now, and indeed clicking anywhere on the page will close any open link menus.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>And that's release number 239 (the number is on the bottom of every page).</p>

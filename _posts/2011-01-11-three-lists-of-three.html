<h1>Three Lists of Three</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.personadev.com/2008/01/28/get-more-done-with-three-lists-of-three/">PersonaDev</a>,&nbsp;a "productivity and personal development blog for the tech savvy",&nbsp;has posted an idea for to-do lists that "sometimes get out of control, growing to gorilla-sized proportions":</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>Make three lists each day as you sit down to work. The first list is for 3 things that you are going to get done today. The second list is for 3 things that you will get done today if you have time. The third list is for 3 things that will get done eventually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not one I practice, but it might work for you.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://addsharedo.com">AddShareDo</a> you could have three tags (perhaps: #do #maybe #eventually) and optionally create a group called "three" or "focus" to easily drill down to just those three tags.<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

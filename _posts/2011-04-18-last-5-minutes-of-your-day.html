<h1>Last 5 minutes of your day</h1>

<p>The Harvard Business Review has a blog entry on&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2011/01/the-best-way-to-use-the-last-f.html">The Best Way to Use the Last Five Minutes of Your Day</a>. &nbsp;Here's the proposition: "Every day, before leaving the office, save a few minutes to think about what just happened. Look at your calendar and compare what actually happened &mdash; the meetings you attended, the work you got done, the conversations you had, the people with whom you interacted, even the breaks you took &mdash; with your plan for what you wanted to have happen."</p>
<p>Add Share Do can help you do this in a couple of ways. &nbsp;First, click that big Activity button at the top of the screen. &nbsp;That will list what you did under a handy "Today" heading, and who helped you.</p>
<p>A slight variation is the daily email feature we've added. &nbsp;Every day at 6am, it sends you an email of recent activity: what you added, what you completed, what your colleagues did. &nbsp;It's not going to be for everyone (you can turn it off on the preferences page), but it might just be the moment of reflection you need.</p>
<p>Add Share do is the to-do list built for sharing. &nbsp;Why not <a href="http://addsharedo.com">try it out today</a>.</p>

<h1>What's new in 410</h1>

<p>This is a bug fix release: Under certain circumstances it would be possible to edit a task and for the task to vanish from your screen. The task would still be there, but you couldn't see it until you viewed the tag again. &nbsp;Release 410 fixes this.</p>
<p>You know the routine: hit reload in your browser to upgrade.</p>

<h1>Assess, Decide, Do</h1>

<p>Despite the similarity in name, <a href="http://assess-decide-do.com/">Assess Decide Do</a> is not connected in any way with our own <a href="http://www.addsharedo.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=assess-decide-do-top">Add Share Do</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You might like to learn about their "life management framework" (yes, it's not just an app, but they do have an app and a book) and it might be the framework you've been looking for. &nbsp;We don't know, but from what we've learned about Assess Decide Do it looks you can apply the methodology using our own ASD.</p>
<p>The steps appear to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Assess - overload your internal system with information: add tasks, ideas, events or projects."</li>
<li>"Decide - 'sign the contract' to actually do that task or project."</li>
<li>"Do - you see only what you decided earlier. Not extra clutter, not floating tasks or events, only what you decide you really want to do."</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be mapped to a couple of tags in Add Share Do. &nbsp;For example, perhaps you have a tag called #assess or #backlog or #maybe. &nbsp;That's what you tag all ideas with. &nbsp;In fact, because Add Share Do automatically tags bookmarks and tasks by email with #viaBookmarklet and #viaEmail you could create a Group called "Assess" that contains the tag you pick and #viaEmail and #viaEmail. (I call my group "Inbox", BTW)</p>
<p>The Do part is another tag, and the natural name would be #do.</p>
<p>Assessing then becomes a process you go through of looking down you #access tag or group, and changing the tag to #do.</p>
<p>When you want to get down to it, just focus in on #do and ... do stuff.</p>
<p>That's another easy way to use Add Share Do. &nbsp;If you've not signed up (and why not?), <a href="http://www.addsharedo.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=assess-decide-do">try it today for free</a>, no credit card needed, no limits on features.</p>

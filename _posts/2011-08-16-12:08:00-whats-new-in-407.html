Build 407 of <a href="http://addsharedo.com">Add Share Do</a> is out. &nbsp;Hit refresh in your browser to upgrade to the new features....</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved shared editing: if someone else is editing a task you're looking at, you'll now see a small lock icon next to the task. &nbsp;It stays there until they've finished editing the task.</li>
<li>Quick new group creation: you can group tags into groups, and to make it easier, we've now added a "New group..." action from the "Viewing" drop-down. &nbsp;Select it to be taken to the page that lets you created and edit groups.</li>
<li>Tag suggestions: as you type, we now suggest tags you might want to add to your task. &nbsp;Click the suggsested tag to add it to your task. &nbsp;There'll be a separate blog post on this feature, but the more tasks you add, the better the suggestions get. &nbsp;You need at least 40 tasks for suggestions to appear, and we don't suggest for tags that haven't been used at least 5 times.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also smaller improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better browser support: IE8, Chrome, Opera, Safari and all working fine with ASD.</li>
<li>Improved sign up form and login forms.</li>
<li>...and the usual smattering of general bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us know how you get on with these features.</p>

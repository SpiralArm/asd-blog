Quietly, a little before the end of the year, we made <a href="http://www.addsharedo.com/">AddShareDo.com</a> live. We were not happy with the balance of simplicity and sharing we found in other applications, so we built what we needed. &nbsp;You can read more on the background on the <a href="http://addsharedo.com/about">about page</a>.</p>
<p>What we think is great about the app is the simplicity...</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 11.6667px;">add tasks by typing them into the big box at the top of the screen. &nbsp;</span></li>
<li>organize tasks with #tags (#today, #tomorrow, #home, whatever you like)</li>
<li>sort to-dos by dragging on screen&nbsp;</li>
<li>share at the #tag level</li>
<li>email in to-dos to your secret AddShareDo email address&nbsp;</li>
<li>group tags to give you a view of the key tags you need&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>We have quite a list of improvements already, but it's been our only day-to-day to-do app for a while now.</p>
<p>We're not making any big announcements at the moment, but feel free to try it out (there's no charging yet), and leave your comments here.</p>

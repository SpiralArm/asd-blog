<p>We've made it easier to share a tag and to see who you're sharing with. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Take a look at your tags in Add Share Do. &nbsp;Next to the tag name you'll see two links: Edit and Share. &nbsp;If you click Share you'll see an area appear that just contains the sharing controls. &nbsp;Click Share again to close the window.</p>
<p>If you add a new address in the Sharing window, it instantly updates and allows you to add more. &nbsp;We think this is a big improvement over the previous screen.</p>
<p>In case you're curious, the Edit button allows you to rename and delete a tag (or leave a tag someone else has shared with you).</p>
<p>Add Share Do is the to-do list built for sharing. &nbsp;You can get get a free, fully-featured, 30 day trial at <a href="http://www.addsharedo.com">AddShareDo.com</a>.</p>

<h1>New and Noteworthy 382</h1>

<p>There's a new version of Add Share Do out today, build number 382. &nbsp;If you hit refresh in your browser you'll see these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>We've made a big improvement to how to edit and share tags. &nbsp;More about this in a separate post, but it means you can click "edit" next to a tag to rename it, and "share" to get a simplified view of who you're sharing and a single place where you can add more people to your tag.</li>
<li>Search has been improved so that the results now show completed tasks, and they're interactive, so you can uncheck them if you want.</li>
<li>There are now more ways to give us feedback: on the bottom of every page, on the help page and on the preferences page. &nbsp;Let us know what you like, what you don't like.</li>
<li>If you're sorting tasks with someone else, the tasks now reorder on the other person's screen in real time.</li>
<li>When you're creating or changing a group of tags (Preferences &gt; Tags and Groups), the tags you pick from are now ordered alphabetically which makes them easier to find.</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest change is that ASD is now a subscription service. &nbsp;It's amazing value (it works out at 84p a month) but you get to try it with a 30 days fully-functioning trial. &nbsp;No credit card needed: <a href="http://www.addsharedo.com">give it a go</a>.&nbsp;</p>

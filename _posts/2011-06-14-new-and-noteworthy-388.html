<h1>New and Noteworthy 388</h1>

<p>Three small changes in release 388 of AddShareDo:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can visit <a href="http://www.addsharedo.com">www.addsharedo.com</a> or addsharedo.com and we've now fixed a bug so&nbsp;when you login to one, and visit the other, you don't have to login again.</li>
<li>Small page changes to make your tasks fit on screen a little better.</li>
<li>We've added a monitoring framework to help us keep track of performance.</li>
</ul>

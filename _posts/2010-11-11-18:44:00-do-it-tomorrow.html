<h1>Do it tomorrow.</h1>

<p>I've finished reading Mark Forster's "<a href="http://www.markforster.net/do-it-tomorrow/">Do it Tomorrow</a>", a book that presents an approach to using time effectively, achieving goals, and having focus. &nbsp;If I'm being uncharitable, there's a bit of coaching flimflam to get through early on ("Effectiveness = Creativity x Order", gah), but this 200 page book is a quick and easy read with some great ideas in it.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">To be clear: I'm not shopping around for the perfect time management methodology. &nbsp;I'm interested in practical, sane, useful techniques that I feel would work for me, and I've found a few in here. Quite a few.</span></p>
<p>What I took away from the book is that there's a surprising amount you can put off, and by doing so you can stay focussed on what you're doing today. &nbsp; Putting things off until tomorrow doesn't mean you're being slack. &nbsp;It means you're giving what you want to do today the attention it needs to get it done.</p>
<p>What can be put off? There are no absolute rules, and you need judgement and common sense to decide if you can simply note down a new action for tomorrow, or if it is one of the rare things that you really do need to handle today.</p>
<p>A good example is post (for those of us who still get some). &nbsp;Open it, but then put it in an in-tray. &nbsp;You know what it is, and if it's&nbsp;genuinely&nbsp;urgent, you can deal with it. &nbsp;But otherwise, it's there waiting for you tomorrow, when you can include it in your plan for that day.</p>
<p>Forster technologies are a diary and a <em>closed</em> list. &nbsp;The distinction to a to-do list that he makes is that to-do lists just accumulate. &nbsp;A closed list is the list of things you <em>will</em> do, and you draw a line under it: nothing else gets added today (subject to common sense). &nbsp;Every day, you complete your closed list. If you don't, well that happens sometimes, but if it happens a lot you stop, move&nbsp;everything&nbsp;into a back-log, start clean, and begin making progress.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other details and ideas in the book, but the last one I'll mention is the "current initiative". &nbsp;This is the goal you want to achieve, and you do something on it every day as the first thing you do. &nbsp;No excuses. &nbsp;If you don't progress your current initiative (whatever it is), it's not going to happen. Doing even a small something every day means you are <em>doing</em> something, progressing the initiative, and by doing it first, it's not going to just slip off the radar and get lost in all the other stuff you do.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">It appears the author has moved on to other techniques (<a href="http://www.markforster.net/autofocus-index/">Autofocus</a>), but there's some nice ideas in DiT. &nbsp;I've found it helpful and&nbsp;restorative.</span></p>

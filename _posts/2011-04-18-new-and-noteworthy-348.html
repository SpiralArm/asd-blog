<p>Version 348 of ASD contains changes for emailing in tasks, tasks that contain links, and groups and tags. &nbsp;Here are the details:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the drop down list of tags and groups you're viewing, "<strong>All Tags</strong>" now appears under "groups" rather than "tags". &nbsp;We think this makes more sense.</li>
<li>When you change the tag or group you're viewing, we now <strong>remember your last selection</strong>. When you login back in to ASD, or if you login on a different browser, on the iPhone or the iPad, we take you to your last selected group or tag.</li>
<li>Talking of which, if you do login on an iPhone or iPad, the <strong>email address login field is a little easier to use</strong> now.</li>
<li>As you know, if you have a task that contains links, we offer a drop down menu giving you access to those links. &nbsp;As of 348, if you have a task that contains just one link, the icon changes and it&nbsp;<strong>takes to you that link with one click</strong>.</li>
<li>We've seen a couple of emailed-in tasks sent to the wrong address. &nbsp;We now send back a warning email if this happens.</li>
<li>On the subject of emailed-in tasks, on the preferences page you can now <strong>download your secret email in address</strong> in a format to add to your adddress book (we've tried it with Google Contacts and the Mac Address Book so far).</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we're thinking about renaming "tags" to "labels". &nbsp; What do you think?</p>

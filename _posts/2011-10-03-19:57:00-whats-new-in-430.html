<h1>What's new in 430</h1>

<p>Release 430 of <a href="http://www.addsharedo.com">Add Share Do</a> contains three bug fixes. &nbsp;Please refresh ASD in your browser to upgrade:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>When viewing your groups, we sometimes didn't summarise the tags in the group. &nbsp;We do now.</li>
<li>When deleting a tag, we now remove it from any groups you've set up.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Entering :s and no word after was producing an error. &nbsp;It will now search for all your tasks, and will take longer than we'd like it to.</li>
<li>It was not possible to change the order of tags. &nbsp;Fixed, and you can again now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for trying ASD and reporting these problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

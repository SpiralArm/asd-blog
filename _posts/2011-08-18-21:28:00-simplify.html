<h1>Simplify.</h1>

<p>Good advice in "<a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/simplify-your-productivity-tools-to-get-more-done.html">Simplify Your Productivity Tools To Get More Done</a>" over at Lifehack: "instead of being buried in a sea of productivity tools and ideas that were not supporting me, for the last year and a half I have been trimming down my system to the most essential and useful".</p>
<p>Here are the authors steps for finding a tool that really helps you:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Go on a productivity tool detox. [...] try something simple like paper for a while. You will find out what you truly need in a system."</li>
<li>"While using the simplest tools possible actually get some work done with them."</li>
<li>"Make a list of things that you absolutely need &ndash; not want &ndash; in a productivity tool and try to find the easiest implementation of it. Try really hard not to go on a quest for the greatest productivity system ever made. It doesn&rsquo;t exist."</li>
<li>"Get settled in with your new set of tools and stick to them. Once you feel that your system supports your work, make a pact to not change your tools for 90 days".</li>
</ol>
<p>As we say in the <a href="http://addsharedo.com/about">about page</a>, simplicity is what we want too. &nbsp;You can <a href="http://addsharedo.com/">give Add Share Do a go</a> and see if it's the tool that supports your work. &nbsp;It might be if you're trying to cut out complexity, and if you need to work with others in real time.</p>

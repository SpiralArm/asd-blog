<p>Refresh your Add Share Do browser window to get the new features just released as verson 418:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tags can now have descriptions. &nbsp;When you share a tag with someone we email them an invitation and now include the description you have given the tag. &nbsp;It provides more context. &nbsp;To set a description click the "edit" button next to the tag name, fill in the field, and press "update". &nbsp;Change your mind as often as you like. &nbsp;Click the "edit" link again to close the edit window.</li>
<li>Add Share Do is not for everyone: you'll find the "close account" link on the Preferences page.</li>
<li>Improved reliability for tasks sent in via email. Before this release it was possible for tasks emailed in to be held up for a day or two if we lost connection to our email server. The longest time now is 30 minutes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're new to Add Share Do, don't forget to <a href="http://addsharedo.com">sign up and try it for free</a>.&nbsp;</p>
